Notes:


General:
--Theme - I want to keep it a dark theme throughout - I do not want it changing to light after home screen
-The mouse cursor should just be a regular pointer - nothing special
-There should be no animation of any kind. No zooming in on the picture. No movement. 
-Logo - should be this color scheme - 
  
-There is too much dead space between the sections - needs to be tighter


Home section - 
-Let’s remove the “scroll” part. It’s overlapping with the text incorrectly anyways. 
  


-The “Brooklyn, NY - Members only” text should be removed


  



The hero shot will be a silhouette of a red 964 911 like one of the shots below (found in adobe - do not download from here). Whichever fits better in the frame. 


  

  

  



About the Club Section

-Need to make sure all of the language is in this section 


Brooklyn Vintage Car Club is a small, private drivers’ club centered on analog, modern-classic cars from the 1990s and 2000s. The emphasis is on driving—quiet, minimal, and practical.
A clean industrial space, a curated fleet, frictionless access, and a small membership base that appreciates substance over spectacle.
The space includes a simple lounge with a low-key, self-serve bar, lockers, and room to decompress before or after drives.
Built for people who value engagement, analog feel, and the clarity of mechanical controls.

Fleet section - 
-Should be titled “Fleet philosophy” because I do not have a fleet yet. Needs all of the below exact text. I am not trying to do a picture per car since I do not have the fleet yet and the cars do not need to be labeled. I just want the 3 example pics below (from adobe)

These need to say “Apply for Waitlist” uniformly NOT “apply for membership”
  

Form looks misaligned - 
  

This should not appear as you scroll. It should all be there.
